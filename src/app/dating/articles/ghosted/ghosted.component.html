  <h2>Are you being ghosted?</h2>
  <p>
    Being ghosted can be really confusing. Is he ever going to respond? 
    Maybe he’s just busy, you tell yourself. But listen, you’re being ghosted. 
    Probably. Or maybe not! It’s hard to tell when you’re actually being ghosted, 
    so I’ll share this example from the last time I dated someone. At some point, 
    I got ghosted, can you tell when?
