      You need time to grieve. Sing along to the songs
      you had with him while crying into a pint of ice cream.
      Just a warning though, you’ll never be able to listen to
      the album Blonde by Frank Ocean ever, ever again.`

      That’s right, don’t just unfriend him, block him. Block his number,
      block his facebook, block his twitter. Don’t forget to set up an email
      filter for all his addresses too, because he will try to follow you
      across the country if he thinks there’s a chance you’ll still talk to him.`

    need to get away! Grab a girlfriend and a suitcase and pick a place,
    any place. Do what I did, go all the way to Belize, and then spend
    the entire time in paradise only talking about your ex. To this day,
    my travel buddy still won’t speak to me.`

    remind you too much of him now? Try something totally new!
    Never been a big social media user? Start a finstagram!
    Accidentally see a picture of him with his new girlfriend.
    Cry a lot! Delete it immediately!`

    is to get under someone new. Redownload tinder and try out all those
    dirty pickup lines you’ve heard about. Go home with a stranger.
    Try not to say your ex’s name by mistake. Try not to say "I love you"
    by accident. Try not to cry.`
